# XML_Parser
XML Parser for a Question and Answer site

Implemented a basic parser to investigate the natural-language posts
from Q&A (Question and Answering) site. 
The parser is able to perform basic data extraction,
statistical analysis on a number of linguistic features and also to present the analysis results
using some form of visualization.
